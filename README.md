# WagonGitExample
Script and sample project to use BitBucket as a private Maven repository.

Please find more details in [this blogpost](http://jeroenmols.com/blog/2016/02/05/wagongit/) and see below on how to [configure your own library](#configure-your-project).

## Usage
In order to test out this project, first ensure that you have a `maven_repository` configured in your BitBucket account, which uses `releases` as its default branch. Next configure the project:

1. Checkout the example source

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:JeroenMols/WagonGitExample.git
    ```

2. Fill in your BitBucket username and password in the root level [gradle.properties](https://github.com/JeroenMols/WagonGitExample/blob/master/gradle.properties) file

  ```groovy
  USERNAME=<username_here>
  PASSWORD=<password_here>
  ```

3. Optionally configure the other parameters in the [gradle.properties](https://github.com/JeroenMols/WagonGitExample/blob/master/library/gradle.properties) file within the library project.

  ```groovy
  ARTIFACT_VERSION=1.0.0
  ARTIFACT_NAME=awesomelibrary
  ARTIFACT_PACKAGE=com.jeroenmols.awesomelibrary
  ARTIFACT_PACKAGING=aar

  COMPANY=jeroenmols   // the name of your team/company in BitBucket
  REPOSITORY_NAME=maven_repository
  ```

4. Run the following command to upload a version to your Maven repository.

  ```bash
  ./gradlew uploadArchives
  ```

Note: Don't commit the root level [gradle.properties](https://github.com/JeroenMols/WagonGitExample/blob/master/gradle.properties) back to version control as this would expose your password! Check [this blogpost](http://localhost:4000/blog/2015/08/13/artifactory2/) password to securely provide your username and password.
